# R package Specification

what defines a (source) package in the R language?

From Hadley Wickham's [R-pkgs book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html):

> Every package must have a DESCRIPTION. In fact, itâ€™s the defining feature of a package (RStudio and devtools consider any directory containing DESCRIPTION to be a package).


Additionally, I think it must also have an `/R` directory in the root of the repository.


### I examine all public github repositories with a `DESCRIPTION` file and an `/R` directory.
